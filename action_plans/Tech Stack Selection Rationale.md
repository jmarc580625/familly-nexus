#  Tech Stack Decisions & Rationale:

1.  **Front-End**:

*   **Your Preference**: You're familiar with basic web pages and JavaScript and are open to recommendations with a manageable learning curve.
*   **Recommendation**: Given the project's need for interactivity and potentially complex UI elements in the future (e.g., family tree visualization, photo browsing), React is a great choice.
    *   **Rationale**:
        *   **Popular and Well-Documented**: React is extremely popular, so there are tons of resources, tutorials, and community support available.
        *   **Component-Based Architecture**: React's component model makes it easy to build reusable UI elements, which is essential for maintainability and scalability.
        *   **Large Ecosystem**: A vast ecosystem of libraries is available to extend React's functionality.
        *   **Progressive Learning**: The core concept are not too hard to learn.
        *   **Future scalability** The architecture of React makes it easy to scale.
    *   **Learning Curve**: While it is not immediate, the learning curve of React is not too steep.
*   **UI Library**: For styling and pre-built components, **Material UI** or **Tailwind CSS** are good options.
    *   **Material UI**: A comprehensive library that provides a wide range of customizable components based on Google's Material Design. It's great for rapidly building polished UIs.
    *   **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows you to style components by applying classes directly in your HTML. It's highly flexible and customizable.
    *   **Selection**: Let's choose React with Material UI for now, but feel free to change.

2. **Back-End**:

*   **Your Preference**: You're familiar with Python and want to consider future GenAI integration.
*   **Recommendation**: Python is an excellent choice for the backend, especially with potential GenAI integration in the future.
    *   **Rationale**:
        *   **GenAI Ecosystem**: Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries for machine learning and AI (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers), making it well-suited for future GenAI features.
        *   **Web Frameworks**: Python has robust web frameworks like Django and Flask.
        *   **Flexibility**: Python is flexible and scalable.
    *   **Framework**: **Flask** is a good option for this project.
        *   **Rationale**: Flask is a lightweight and flexible microframework, ideal for building APIs. It provides the essentials without being overly prescriptive. If the project grows very large and complex, we can revisit the decision and migrate to Django later.

3. **API**:

*   **Your Preference**: RESTful API.
*   **Recommendation**: RESTful API is a great choice.
    *   **Rationale**:
        *   **Standard**: REST is the most common and well-understood API style.
        *   **Scalable**: RESTful APIs are stateless and scalable.
        *   **Clear Structure**: REST provides a clear way to organize resources and operations.
    *   **Alternatives**:
        *   **GraphQL**: A newer API style that offers more flexibility in querying data. It's worth considering if your data model becomes very complex, but it adds complexity.
        *   **gRPC**: A high-performance, contract-based API style often used for microservices. It's typically overkill for a project of this size initially.
    *   **Benefits of REST**: REST is the most used option, it is well documented, easy to learn, and easy to use.

4. **Database**:

*   **Your Preference**: You're looking for efficient indexing and retrieval, and you're open to non-relational databases due to the nature of people networking.
*   **Recommendation**: PostgreSQL with the use of JSONB type.
    *   **Rationale**:
        *   **Relational Strengths**: While non-relational databases (e.g., MongoDB) are great for flexible data, the family tree is inherently relational. We need to store relationships between people and ensure data integrity.
        *   **JSONB**: This feature allows for flexible storage of nested data, which can be useful for storing additional information about people and photos. This allows for flexibility like a NoSQL database but without losing the benefit of a relational database.
        *   **Indexing**: PostgreSQL offers powerful indexing features that are critical for fast searching and filtering.
        *   **JSONB Indexing**: You can index data inside JSONB fields, making it efficient to query based on nested attributes.
        *   **Future-Proof**: If you want to integrate more advanced graph features later (e.g., network analysis), PostgreSQL can handle graph data well using extensions like pg_tgrm.
    *   **Alternatives**:
        *   **MongoDB**: A popular NoSQL database that is very flexible. However, it is not as performant as a relational database when dealing with relational data.
        *   **Neo4j**: is a specialized database for graph storage. It could be a good choice, but it is also very specialized.
*   **Selection**: Let's choose PostgreSQL with JSONB for now.

5. **Object Storage**:

*   **Your Preference**: File system to start with.
*   **Recommendation**: Using the local file system is fine for initial development.
    *   **Rationale**: It simplifies setup and avoids cloud storage costs at the beginning.
    *   **Transition**: We should plan to move to cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) when we're ready for testing and deployment.

6. **Other Tools**:

*   **Source Repository**: GitHub (excellent choice).
*   **CI/CD**: Poetry (great for Python). We can integrate it with GitHub Actions for a complete CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Package Management**: npm (for React) and Poetry (for Python).
*   **Docker**: Agreed. Docker is excellent for development and deployment.
*   **Virtual env**: This is good practice.

# Vector Database and Future AI Evolutions
Vector databases are becoming increasingly important for AI applications, especially those involving:

*   **Semantic Search**: Finding information based on meaning, not just keywords.
*   **Recommendation Systems**: Suggesting relevant content based on user behavior or similarities.
*   **Image and Video Similarity Search**: Finding similar images or videos based on their visual features.
*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Analyzing and understanding text.

**How Vector Databases Fit In with Our Proposal**:

1.  **PostgreSQL + pgvector Extension**: This is the most practical way to incorporate vector database capabilities into our project without introducing a completely new database technology.

*   **Rationale**:
    *   **Single Database**: By using a PostgreSQL extension, we can keep all our data (relational, JSON, and vector) in one database. This simplifies management and development.
    *   **Early Vector Capabilities**: pgvector provides essential vector storage and search functionality, allowing us to experiment with vector embeddings early on.
    *   **Gradual Adoption**: We can start storing simple vector embeddings (e.g., generated by a Python script) and incrementally explore more complex vector use cases as we add AI features.
    *   **Flexibility**: If at some point we decide that we need a dedicated vector database, the migration can be done.
*  **How it Works**:
    *   We can add a new column to the photos table (or a related table) with a vector data type.
    *   We can also add a column to the people table.
    *   We can use Python (with libraries like pgvector-python, langchain) to generate vector embeddings for photos and descriptions.
    *   We can then store these embeddings in the vector columns.
    *   We can then use SQL queries (with pgvector functions) to perform vector similarity searches.
*   **When to migrate to another solution**: The main limitations are : the scalability of PostgreSQL for vector search, and the performance of advanced search. This will be a good time to consider another tool.

2.  **Dedicated Vector Databases (Future Consideration)**:

*   If, in the future, our vector search requirements become extremely demanding (e.g., very large datasets, high query rates), we might want to consider a dedicated vector database like:
    *   **Pinecone**: A managed vector database service.
    *   **Weaviate**: An open-source vector search engine.
    *   **Qdrant**: Another open-source vector search engine.

*   **When to Consider Migration**: We'll consider a migration if:
    *   We're dealing with massive vector datasets that are causing performance issues with PostgreSQL.
    *   We need very low-latency vector search that's not achievable with PostgreSQL.
    *   We need specialized vector indexing or search algorithms that are not available in pgvector.

*  **Migration Strategy**: If we decide to migrate, we will:
    *   Create a migration plan for extracting data and moving it to the dedicated database.
    *   Ensure that the API remains compatible with the front-end.
    *   Re-index the data in the new vector database.
