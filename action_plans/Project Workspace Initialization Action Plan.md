# Project Workspace Initialization Action Plan : FamillyNexus

## Phase 1: Project Definition & Setup (High-Level)

**Objective:** Define the project's core purpose, scope, and basic structure.

**Actions:**

1.  **Define Project Goal:**

    - **Core Purpose:** To create a digital platform that allows family members to explore and share their collective memories through photos, genealogical information, and rich contextual details. The goal is to go beyond a simple photo album, providing tools for enhanced discovery and connection with family history.
    - **Problem Solved:** This addresses the challenge of preserving and accessing family memories scattered across various physical media and formats. It provides a centralized, searchable, and interactive platform, making it easier to share and discover family history.
    - **Desired Outcomes:**
      - A searchable and browsable archive of family photos, organized chronologically and thematically.
      - A detailed and linked family tree (genealogy) including relationships (blood, friendship, etc.) beyond basic family ties.
      - Ability to add rich contextual information (dates, locations, detailed stories/narratives) to photos and individuals.
      - Automated extraction of metadata from photos (location, date/time).
      - AI-powered features (e.g., face recognition for photo tagging, automated generation of photo descriptions) _(Considered for future phases)_
      - Natural language querying of the "augmented family album."
      - Interactive timelines visualizing family events and relationships.
      - Geographic visualization of locations mentioned in photos or family history on maps.
      - Secure sharing capabilities for family members.

2.  **Determine Project Scope (MVP - Minimum Viable Product):**

    - **In Scope (Initial):**

      - Ability to upload and store family photos (basic organization features)
      - Create and edit a family tree (basic linking of individuals) and ability to add relationships beyond basic family.
      - Adding descriptive text (short narratives) to photos and people.
      - Basic search functionality (by name, date, keywords).
      - **EXIF-based metadata extraction from uploaded photos (location, date/time).**

    - **Out of Scope (Initial):**
      - Advanced AI-powered features (face recognition, automated description generation).
      - Complex data extraction beyond basic EXIF data.
      - Natural language querying.
      - Interactive timelines and geographic visualizations.
      - Advanced sharing and permission settings.

    - **VS Code Workspace Settings**:
      - Create a .vscode directory in the root of your project (d:\familly-nexus).
      - Inside .vscode, create a file named settings.json.
      - Add project-specific settings to settings.json. For example:
        ```
        {
            "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "${workspaceFolder}/.venv/Scripts/python.exe", // Adapt if different OS or different Python path
            "python.formatting.provider": "black",
            "python.linting.flake8Enabled": true,
            "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
            "editor.formatOnSave": true,
            "editor.tabSize": 4
        }
        ```
    - **Environment Variables**:
      - Create a .env file in the root of your project (d:\familly-nexus).
      - In the .env file, add your environment variables. For example:
        ```
        POSTGRES_HOST=db
        POSTGRES_PORT=5432
        POSTGRES_DB=familynexus
        POSTGRES_USER=postgres
        POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
        ```

3.  **Setup the data storage:**

    - **Objective**: Get the database (PostgreSQL with pgvector) up and running in a Docker container.

    1. **Customise the postgres image**: to add the pgvector extension.

    - Create a `Dockerfile` in the root of your project (`d:\familly-nexus`) with the following contents:

      ```
      FROM postgres:16-alpine

      RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
        postgresql-16-pgvector \
        && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
      ```

    2. **Docker Compose File**:

    - Create a docker-compose.yml file in the root of your project (`d:\familly-nexus`).

      ```
      version: '3.8'

      services:
        db:
          build:
            context: .
            dockerfile: Dockerfile
          container_name: family-nexus-db
          restart: always
          environment:
            - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
            - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
            - POSTGRES_DB=familynexus
          ports:
            - "127.0.0.1:5432:5432" #bind to localhost only
          volumes:
            - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
          healthcheck:
            test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U postgres"]
            interval: 5s
            timeout: 5s
            retries: 5
            start_period: 10s

      volumes:
        db-data:
      ```

    3. \*\*Rebuild the image"

       ```
       docker compose up -d --build
       ```

    4. **Start the Database Container**:
       ```
       cd d:\familly-nexus
       docker compose up -d
       docker compose ps
       docker exec -it family-nexus-db psql -U postgres -d familynexus
         CREATE EXTENSION vector;
         \q
       ```

4.  **Create Initial File Structure:**

    - Set up a basic file and folder structure within the project directory.
    - (This will be clarified in Q&A)

5.  **Test Environment:**
    - Run a simple "Hello, World!" program to ensure everything is working.

## Phase 3: Initial Code Structure (Basic)

**Objective:** Set up the minimal viable code structure to start development.

**Actions:**

    - Set up the basic modules or components of your application.
    - (This will be clarified in Q&A)

2.  **Write Initial Tests:**

    - Create basic unit tests for the core modules.
    - (This will be clarified in Q&A)

3.  **Document Setup:**

    - Add a description to your README.md file.
    - Consider adding a more in depth documentation like a "doc" folder.
    - Consider adding a wiki to your repository

4.  **Review and Refine:**
    - Review the initial setup and make any necessary adjustments.
    - Seek feedback from other developers (if applicable).
